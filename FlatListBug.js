This bug occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native with a large dataset.  The issue is that the FlatList renders many items at once, leading to performance issues, especially on lower-end devices.  Additionally, if the data source changes frequently, the FlatList can become unresponsive or crash. The provided code shows a FlatList that renders a large number of items without optimization, causing slow rendering and potential crashes.
